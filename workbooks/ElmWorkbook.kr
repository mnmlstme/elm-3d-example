# Elm in 3D

We can build up 3D forms using Elm and render them in a WebGL scene.

```
Block3d.from
    (Point3d.meters -0.3 0 0.2)
    (Point3d.meters 0.3 0.01 0.4)
```

We can put lots of examples in the same file like this...

```
Block3d.from
    (Point3d.meters -0.3 1 0.2)
    (Point3d.meters 0.3 1.01 0.4)
```
